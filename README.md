## **Narcissistic Traits in the General Population**

A Fundamentals of Data Science with Python Project

üìå What the project does

This project analyzes narcissistic traits in the general population using the Big Five personality model and the IPIP-NEO-120 dataset (~400k participants).

Maps DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) onto Big Five facets.

Identifies six key facets (e.g., Modesty, Altruism, Sympathy) whose low poles align with narcissistic tendencies.

Uses percentile thresholds to define ‚Äúlow‚Äù traits and estimate prevalence.

Explores co-occurrence of traits and compares findings with DSM-5 clinical criteria.

üåü Why the project might be useful

This work provides:

A data-driven perspective on narcissistic traits without making clinical diagnoses.

Insight into how common ‚Äúeveryday narcissistic behaviors‚Äù (e.g., arrogance, selfishness) are in the population.

A clear framework for linking clinical psychology concepts to statistical analysis and machine learning methods.

A portfolio-ready project for anyone interested in psychology, data science, or the intersection of both.

üí° Start by reading the "Narcissism & Big Five Data Science Project.pdf" file. You will find the work process and the results of the Analysis.
    You can then find the corresponding Python code used to analyze the data in the Jupyter Notebook.
